This directory contains project documentation and research notes that were previously in the repository root.

Moved files:
- FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- RESEARCH_REPORT_GETNODE_SETNODE.md
- RESEARCH_REPORT_NUNCHAKU_INTEGRATION.md
- dev_track.md
- development.md
- research.md

Example artifacts:
- examples/basic.ai.json
- examples/workflow-flux-lora-upscaler-*.json

Rationale:
- Keep the repo root clean and focused on code.
- Make docs and examples easier to discover.
